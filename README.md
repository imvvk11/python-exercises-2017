simple programming questions solved using python.


OS - Windows

Install python on your system from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Now from cmd type > python

and what you get should look like this: Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 07:18:10) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32 Type "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.

If you get an error message like this:
"python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file."

Then it means that python has not been installed on your computer or probably python is not saved in the path environment variable of your computer, so you cannot run Python from any location without having to constantly reference the full installation path name.

After installing python you have to install pip: Download get-pip.py: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py to a folder on your computer. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder containing get-pip.py. Then run >> python get-pip.py

This will install pip.

check pip --version from cmd

Now to install jupyter notebook from cmd type: >> pip install jupyter notebook This will install jupyter notebook

Now from windows cmd change directory to where you have put your complete-python-bootcamp-master folder.

Now from your windows cmd type >> jupyter notebook

Then you will see these on your cmd:
[I 14:23:06.434 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation). [C 14:23:06.439 NotebookApp] http://localhost:8888/?token=bc0be2222c30202714d21024d3a5898a3f28eb28dff458f9 [I 14:23:10.781 NotebookApp] Accepting one-time-token-authenticated connection from 127.0.0.1

Now open your default browser or click on the http://localhost:8888/ to open your jupyter notebook you will see the complete-python-bootcamp-master folder, open it and you will find programming queations and solutions in python. It contains .ipynb files, open it ad enjoy!
